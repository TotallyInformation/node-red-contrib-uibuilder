    <p>
        Provides a stand-alone web server that allows for interfacing with Node-RED, while giving you help and complete freedom to create custom web interfaces.<br><br>

        You need at least one of these in order to make full use of all of uibuilder's features.
    </p><p>
        It is this node that creates a custom web server. You can have many nodes if that best meets your needs. But each node can serve many pages.
    </p><p>
        It also creates a set of filing system folders and files on the Node-RED server. 
        These define the front-end UI you see in the browser as well as providing some important configuration.
    </p><p>
        This node is also where you configure much of uibuilder's web server such as installing helper libraries that 
        you may wish to use to support your interfaces (e.g. VueJS, jQuery, etc). You can also use it to edit your custom UI code.

    <h3>Status display</h3>
    <p>
        Each instance (node) of uibuilder has a status display. Normally, the icon is blue.
        When 1 or more clients are connected, the text will show how many clients are connected.

            Libraries will be loaded into your <code>&lt;userDir>/</code> folder in the same place as custom nodes.
            uibuilder retains an internal list of front-end libraries loaded this way.

    <h3>Admin Index (Details) page</h3>
    <p>
        The <a href="uibindex" target="_blank">&lt;admin url&gt;/uibindex</a> page lists all of the uibuilder endpoints and other details. You can use the following parameters:
    </p>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>type <span class="property-type">(string)</span></dt>
        <dd>
            The type of the data returned.
            <dl class="message-properties">
                <dt>html <span class="property-type">(default)</span></dt>
                <dd>
                    Also used if no type parameter is given. 
                    Returns an HTML page showing the details for all deployed uibuilder nodes.
                    Shows the server file locations of the instance and for vendor libraries.

        <dt>check <span class="property-type">(string)</span></dt>
        <dd>
            Passing a uibuilder instance name to the check parameter will result in a boolean (true/false)
            return. True if it is being delivered by a uibuilder instance,
