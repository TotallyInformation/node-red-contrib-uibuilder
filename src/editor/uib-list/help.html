<p>
    <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b> Node demonstrating a way of building a ui element from a node.<br>
    <b>This node requires the "new" front-end client library</b> (either the IIFE or ESM version).
</p>
<p>
    Please try out the example in the import library.
</p>

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>payload <span class="property-type">array | object</span></dt>
    <dd>
        The array or object that defines the output list.<br>
        A simple array of strings can be used for UL/OL lists. An array of key/value objects is needed for DL lists.
    </dd>

    <dt class="optional">mode <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd> Optionally, set to "remove" which will remove the list from the UI. Payload is not needed in this case, it will be ignored.</dd>

    <dt class="optional">topic <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd> Optionally, the MQTT topic to use. Takes preference over the topic defined in settings.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Outputs</h3>
<ol class="node-ports">

    <li>List Configuration (Optional output)
        <dl class="message-properties">
            <dt>_uib <span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
            <dd>
                <code>msg._uib.originator</code> contains the node id of the originating uib-list node.
            </dd>

            <dt>_ui <span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
            <dd>
                The _ui configuration properties that defines the creation of the list.<br>
                Use this in your own flows or in a JSON input for an initial setup of the UI if desired.
            </dd>

            <dt>topic <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
            <dd>
                The input topic.
            </dd>
    </li>

</ol>

<h3>Node Settings</h3>
<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>URL <span class="property-type">selection</span></dt>
    <dd>The uibuilder instance to connect to.</dd>

    <dt>List ID <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>
        The HTML element id of the resulting list tag.<br>
        This is required otherwise later updates and removals cannot happen.
    </dd>

    <dt>Type <span class="property-type">selection</span></dt>
    <dd>
        What kind of list to create?<br>
        <ul>
            <li>UL: Unordered list (bullets)</li>
            <li>OL: Ordered list (numbered)</li>
            <li>
                DL: Definition list (Term/Definition). This type needs to receive at least key/value objects.
                The key will be used as the term and the value as the definition.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>Parent <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>
        A CSS selector that the new list will be attached to.
        E.g. "div#myid" or just "#myid" would attach the list as a child of a DIV tag with an id of <code>myid</code>.<br>
        "p.myclass" would attach the list as a child of a P tag that has a class including <code>myclass</code>.
        <p>
            If a parent is not specified, the list will be added as a new child of the <code>body</code> tag. (e.g. the end of the UI)
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Output instead of send <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>
        By default, output is sent to the linked uibuilder node and therefore to any connected clients.<br>
        Selecting this flag, an output port is added to the node. The output contains the standard msg._ui object.
        You can use that in your own flows or loaded JSON configuration. In that case, the msg is not forwarded to clients.
    </dd>

    <dt>Name <span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>A short description shown in the admin interface</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
    You define the type of list and the parent uibuilder node and then send a payload to the node to create/update the list.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to sending a simple array, you can send an object. The objects keys will be prefixed onto the values in the list display. 
    Nested objects will be flattened into comma-separated text.
</p>
<p>
    To empty the cache and remove from the connected clients, send a msg containing a <code>mode</code> property set to "remove".
