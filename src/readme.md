This folder contains source code for uibuilder.

Any code that requires some form of build step is mastered here.

* `components`

  Contains any custom web (w3c) components included in the uibuilder core.

* `editor`

  Contains folders for any node that needs more complex configuration of code in the Editor.

  Note that, as from v6+, this folder is less used since the Editor code has been restructured.

* `elements`

  Will be used for any extended code used for specific element types in the `uib-element` node.

* `front-end-module`

  Contains any front-end (browser client) libraries such as the main library, the ui library and the router library.
