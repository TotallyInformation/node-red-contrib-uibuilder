            This is the <i>fallback master page</i> for uibuilder. If you are seeing it, you have an error in your configuration.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have just deleted dist/index.html from your local uibuilder folder, please restart Node-RED so that the src folder is used.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't have a local src/index.html, please add one. 
            The easiest way is to choose one of the built-in templates and click the "Load & Overwrite Files" button
            and accept the warning.
