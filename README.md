# UIBUILDER FOR Node-RED

> **Easy data-driven web UI's. Batteries included!**

UIBUILDER is a Node-RED add-on that makes it easy to build custom web UIs that talk to your flows (web applications). It supports no-code &amp; low-code nodes (create UI from Node-RED itself), full-code front-end templates you edit, and everything in between.

*No-code and Low-code options, driven from Node-RED* || *Dynamic data interchange Node-RED <--> browser* || *No front-end framework needed but use any of them if you want to* || *Integrate with existing web development workflows*

It includes many helper features that can reduce or eliminate the need to write code for building data-driven web applications and user interfaces integrated with Node-RED.

## Installation

UIBUILDER is best installed using Node-RED's Palette Manager.

<details><summary>Manual installs and other versions</summary>

To install manually, from a command line on your Node-RED server:

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-uibuilder
```

To install old versions, provide the major version number:

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-uibuilder@v5
```

To install development branches, please install from [GitHub](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder). Branchnames are usually future version numbers, check GitHub for available branches:

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
npm install totallyinformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder#v7.1.0
```

You will need to restart Node-RED if installing manually.
</details>

## Quickstart Guide

For a super-quick start, once installed, please see the [Getting Started](quickstart) guide.

For more guidance, check out the [First-timers walkthrough](https://totallyinformation.github.io/node-red-contrib-uibuilder/#/walkthrough1) in the documentation and the [Introduction Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVWR_3cx05A).

Also try out the built-in example flows (via the Node-RED Import menu).

## Documentation and other links

Refer to the [Documentation web site](https://totallyinformation.github.io/node-red-contrib-uibuilder). This can also be accessed from within UIBUILDER nodes even without an Internet connection.

There is a library of "official" [video tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9IEADRqAal3mG3RcF0cJaaxIgFh3GdRQ). Other folk have also produced [UIBUILDER-related content](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=UIBUILDER+node-red).

The [Node-RED Forum](https://discourse.nodered.org/) has a dedicated [UIBUILDER tag](https://discourse.nodered.org/tag/node-red-contrib-uibuilder) for questions, discussions, ideas, support, examples and FAQ's.

You can use the [GitHub issues log](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder/issues) for raising issues.

There is also a dedicated [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/980480639679725689/1416125488950411295).

## Purpose

The purpose of UIBUILDER is to:

* Support easy methods for creating and delivering data-driven web apps and web pages (also known as web User-Interfaces).
* Be a conduit between Node-RED and front-end (browser) UI web apps.
* Be UI framework agnostic. No framework is needed to use UIBUILDER but it will work with them where desired. UIBUILDER aims to reduce the requirement for a framework by making it easier to work with vanilla HTML/CSS.
* Provide interface/data standards for exchanging data and controls between Node-RED and the web pages.
* Enable the creation and management of multiple web apps from a single Node-RED instance.
* Reduce the amount of front-end code (HTML/JavaScript) needed to create and manage a web app.
* Reduce the knowledge required for creating reliable, accessible web apps by providing low-code and no-code features. But still ensure that any learning is applicable to general web development.
* Make it easy to install and serve front-end libraries to support the development of more complex web apps.

## Compatibility of current release

* Servers:
  * Node-RED: v4+
  * Node.js: v18+ LTS (matches Node-RED v4+ requirements)
  * Platforms: Linux, Windows, MacOS, Raspberry Pi, Docker, FlowFuse, etc.
* Browsers: 
  * CSS - 0.12% or above of global usage but not Internet Explorer ([ref.](https://browserslist.dev/?q=Pj0wLjEyJSwgbm90IGllID4gMA%3D%3D)). The uncompiled CSS should work in all current mainstream browsers. The compiled CSS (`uib-brand.min.css`) should work in browsers back to early 2019, possibly before. Enforced by [LightningCSS](https://lightningcss.com/).
  * JavaScript - ES6+ so should work in all current mainstream browsers. The compiled JS (`uibuilder.min.{iife|esm}.js`) should work in browsers back to early 2019, possibly before. Enforced by [ESBuild](https://esbuild.github.io/). Script (IIFE) and Module (ESM) versions are provided.

## Updates

The current [CHANGELOG](https://totallyinformation.github.io/node-red-contrib-uibuilder/#/CHANGELOG.md) contains all of the changes and requirement details for each version.
