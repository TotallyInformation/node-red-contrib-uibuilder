title: Documentation for the modern, modular front-end client `uibuilder.esm.js` and `uibuilder.iife.js`
description: >
   This is the new uibuilder front-end library initially introduced in v5.1. It provides socket.io message connectivity to and from Node-RED, simplified message handling and a simple event handler for monitoring for new messages along with some helper utility functions. It also allows data-/configuration-driven interfaces to be created from JSON or Node-RED messages. IIFE (UMD) and ESM builds of the client are provided.
