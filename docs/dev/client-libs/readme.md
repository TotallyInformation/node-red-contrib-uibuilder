* [`ui.js`](dev/client-libs/ui) - Client and server low-code to HTML conversion
* [`uibuilder.module.js`](dev/client-libs/uibuilder-module) - The main, current front-end client library.
* [`uibuilderfe.js`](dev/client-libs/uibuilderfe) - The older front-end client library, no longer being developed.
