  Deep dives into the internals of UIBUILDER. This is where to go if you need to understand how things work. These documents may lag behind the actual code however, so it is always worth also referencing the current codebase.

* [Processes](processes/README.md)

* [Server Libraries](dev/server-libs/README.md) - Information on each of the server libraries

  These libraries are used by some or all of the uibuilder nodes.

  * [`admin-api-v2.js`](dev/server-libs/admin-api-v2) - Older server admin API's. Called from the Node-RED Editor.
  * [`admin-api-v3.js`](dev/server-libs/admin-api-v3) - Newer server admin API's. Called from the Node-RED Editor.
  * [`fs.js`](dev/server-libs/fs) - Server filing system handling.
  * [`package-mgt.js`](dev/server-libs/package-mgt) - npm package handling.
  * [`socket.js`](dev/server-libs/socket) - Socket.IO server handling.
  * [`tilib.js`](dev/server-libs/tilib) - Various non-uibuilder specific server functions.
  * ~~[`tilogger.js`](dev/server-libs/tilogger)~~ - Custom server logger, not currently in use.
  * [`uiblib.js`](dev/server-libs/uiblib) - Generic uibuilder functions.
  * [`web.js`](dev/server-libs/web) - ExpressJS web server handling.

* [Client Libraries](dev/client-libs/README.md) - Information on each of the front-end client libraries.

  These libraries support client (browser) HTML interactions with Node-RED.

  * [`ui.js`](dev/client-libs/ui) - Client and server low-code to HTML conversion
  * [`uibuilder.module.js`](dev/client-libs/uibuilder-module) - The main, current front-end client library.
  * [`uibuilderfe.js`](dev/client-libs/uibuilderfe) - The older front-end client library, no longer being developed.

* uibuilder node
  * [`nodes/uibuilder.js`](dev/uibuilder-js.md) - Main node definition.
  * [`nodes/uibuilder.html`](dev/uibuilder-html.md) - Node-RED Editor configuration panel for the main node.
    
    This is not developed directly. The actual code to edit is in `src/editor/uibuilder/` and is built using `gulp` scripts.

* uibuilder front-end client library

  For details, see the Client Libraries list above.

  * `front-end/uibuilder.iife.min.js` & `front-end/uibuilder.esm.min.js` Modern library builds
  
    These are generated by a `gulp` script that uses `esbuild` from `src/front-end-module/uibuilder.module.js`.

  * [`front-end/uibuilderfe.min.js`](dev/uibuilderfe-js.md) - Old `uibuilderfe` client library
    
    This is generated by a `gulp` script from `src/front-end/uibuilderfe.dev.js`.

* uib-cache node - TBC
* uib-element node - TBC
* uib-update node - TBC
* uib-sender node - TBC
* Gulp scripts - TBC

## Testing

Some information on testing uibuilder. Unfortunately, I have no real clue about automated testing and TLD, if you would like to contribute something, please do!
