title: Using ESBUILD to control output formats
description: >
  As UIBUILDER gets more complex and needs to work in different server and client environments, it is more important to control JavaScript output formats
  and to build minified versions of JavaScript, CSS and even HTML in some cases. The ESBUILD tool is used for this along with GULP for automation.
