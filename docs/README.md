It includes many helper features that can reduce or eliminate the need to write code for building data-driven web applications and user interfaces. It utilises standard HTML/CSS and is not a framework. You can use it with a front-end framework if you like, but in many cases you won't need one.

> [!TIP]
> All you need to start making use of UIBUILDER is a `uibuilder` node added to your flows. Select a suitable URL path and deploy. Then click on the "Open url" button to open the new page in a new tab.
> 
> That's it, batteries are included!

Now you can decide how you want to build your UI. You can craft it by hand, use external editors, create configuration JSON or use one of the no-code nodes. Or even use any combination of these styles - UIBUILDER never locks you in!

Once you have some UI, you can now send and receive data messages to and from your connected browser pages and Node-RED. Using them to update the UI and get user input.

UIBUILDER comes with *templates* to give you some front-end code to get you started. Load a different template if you like, use the editor to customise the UI. Use the library manager if you need any front-end libraries or frameworks (this adds the appropriate folders to the web server so that you can access them from your UI).

UIBUILDER also comes with a number of *example flows*. These are accessed from Node-RED's "hamburger" menu, import entry. They are fully working flows that demonstrate the use of UIBUILDER.

The best way to get started is to add a uibuilder node or import one of the examples, then start playing. You will soon get the hang of it.

> [!NOTE]
> These are the docs for UIBUILDER v7. If you need the v6 or earlier docs, the easiest way is to set up a test instance of Node-RED and manually install the appropriate UIBUILDER version: `npm install node-red-contrib-uibuilder@5` then use the documentation links from a `uibuilder` node.
