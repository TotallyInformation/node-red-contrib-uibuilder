All you need is a uibuilder node added to your flows. Select a suitable URL path and deploy.
Now you can send messages to your front end and send messages back to Node-RED.

uibuilder comes with some simple default templates, front-end code files that define your user interface (UI).
Open the uibuilder node and click on the button to open your web app in a new tab. Load a different template if you like, use the editor to customise the UI and the library manager if you need any front-end libraries or frameworks.
