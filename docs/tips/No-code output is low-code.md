The no-code nodes such as `uib-element` and `uib-update` actually output *low-code configuration data*. While this will normally be sent direct to the client and turned into HTML automatically, you can also examine the output and make your own changes and enhancements before sending it. You can even pass it to a `uib-html` node to convert it to HTML right in a Node-RED flow.
